        "There’s an ongoing program with animal homelessness in Massachusetts. On October 31, 2012, a law took effect that, in part, created the Homeless Animal Prevention and Care Fund (Massachusetts Animal Fund). The Fund is administered by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources with assistance from an advisory committee and seeks to end the problem of animal homelessness in Massachusetts. This program is solely funded by the voluntary tax check-off (Line 33f) on the Massachusetts resident income tax form and by monetary donations. — Mass Animal Fund"
