        "“Jewelry Triptych” is a three piece oil painting set I created to illustrate the disconnect between material costs and fashion accessories. This piece was created using oil paints on a oak backed  canvas. The jewelery on the painting is created using waste paper from containers found outside the Shanghai International Fashion Center (SIFC) creating a newspaper collage. These papers add depth to the triptych as the jewelry is made from waste instead of the high cost items that jewelry often is created from. Like jewelry pendants the triptych has three parts and offers the viewer three articles of jewelry. The female figure in the triptych represents the humans who are oppressed by the pressure of society's stereotypes via the sheer weight of the jewelry."
