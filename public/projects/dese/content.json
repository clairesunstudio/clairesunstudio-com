        "I worked closely with the Department of Education and Secondary Education on developing this interactive data story to highlight the impact of the ABCs by following a group of students from the time they entered 9th grade, to when each left or completed high school. In this project, my work includes storyboading with exisiting data, data visualization design, prototyping, website development and deployment and user testing. The site was built using React with a highly componentized front end and a light weight page load."

        "This data story provides information for parents, community members, and educators from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (ESE) on how attendance, behavior, and course performance in Massachusetts high schools affects post-secondary outcomes. ESE has data programs to collect student and school data and create analytics, but not all of them are easily consumerable by the public. This data story aims to convert their findings into narrative report to make the high school cohort data more accessible and impactful to students, parents and educators."
