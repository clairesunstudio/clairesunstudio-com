        "This is a collaborative project based on researching and user-testing. We were asked to select a route and create a map for someone who would be carrying a 6 foot wide umbrella navigating from MFA to the Presidentâ€™s Gallery on foot. My group went through extensive research and user testing to ensure the route is the most efficient and the map is user-friendly. My role was to lead the user research and product design."
