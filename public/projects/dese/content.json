        "As part of a multi-faceted effort to combat the opioid epidemic, Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2015 was passed by the Legislature and signed into law by Governor Baker. MassIT worked closely with DPH on visualizing the datasets and created an interactive data story to engage the public on this subject. As the designer and developer of this project, I worked closely with the data team from concept sketching, designing data visualizations, prototyping, developing into the final deployment and performance analytics."
