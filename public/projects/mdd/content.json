        "The Facebook Fan uses Facebook Graph API and allows users to experience what pages are the most popular and what people have the most fans. By simply typing in the Facebook Page name/ID. usersou can enjoy the cooling sensation of different levels generated by the Facebook Page fans. The first working prototype was made using a small CPU fan which runs on 12 DC volts, a transistor circuit and a microprocessor. The final version of Facebook Fan is a compact mobile device that can plug into and control any AC fans or home cooling devices, so that the users are able to have a fuller experience of the higher flow fan.This device supplies a multi-sensory experience by producing a cooling sensation, along with humming sounds and visual speeds, to let people don’t only see the cool and hear the cool, but also feel it."

        "“Useless” and “machine” are inherently a pair of contrary concepts. Influential designer Bruno Munari first married these two words together by calling his inventions the “useless machine”. As artist, designer and innovator, his famous useless machine idea was to “free these forms [geometrical shapes] from the static nature of a picture [the futurism paintings] and hang them in the air”. Although they were functionally “useless”, they were not without a purpose. His work was intended to “re-establish the long-lost contact between art and the public, between living people and art as a living thing.”"
