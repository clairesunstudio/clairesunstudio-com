                          I worked closely with the Department of Education and Secondary Education on developing this interactive data story to highlight the impact of the ABCs by following a group of students from the time they entered 9th grade, to when each left or completed high school. In this project, my work includes storyboading with exisiting data, data visualization design, prototyping, website development and deployment and user testing. The site was built using React with a highly componentized front end and a light weight page load.

                          As the designer and developer of this interactive data story on the MA opioid epidemic, I worked from concept sketching, data visualization designing, prototyping, and iterating, into the final deployment. The code repository was also made public as the pilot project of Mass.gov’s open-source initiative.
