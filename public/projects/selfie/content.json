        "This projects is fundamentally designed to give viewers a visual insight into the phenomenon of human labeling that plagues society today. Although labeling is a natural way for humans to learn as well as an important method for machine learning, we have to be mindful when using this method and knowing that labeling can be a dangerously incorrect representation of an individual. Looking at the selfie identifier we can see many incorrect labels. With the removal of labels we will be able to show respect to all members of society regardless of their appearance, gender, race, or creed."
