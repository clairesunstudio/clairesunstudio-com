        "Inspired by the artist movement “The Exquisite Corpse”, the fundamental idea of WeFilm is to record a short video and pass it onto the next person to continue recording. When a clip is ﬁnished, it is uploaded to the server and whoever receives the request to continue is able to view the previous clip, and then record a video response. In the end, the server will combine the clips and generate a ﬁnal video to save and share."
