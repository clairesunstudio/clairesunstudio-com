        "The Facebook Fan is a Facebook Graph API: that allows easy access to the amount of likes for any Facebook Page without any authorization from the individual or company making it simple to find what pages are the most popular and what people have the most fans. Simply type in the Facebook Page name/ID, you can enjoy the cooling sensation of different levels generated by the Facebook Page fans. The first working prototype was made using a small CPU fan which runs on 12 DC volts, a transistor circuit and a microprocessor. The final version of Facebook Fan is a compact mobile device that can plug into and control any AC fans or home cooling devices, so that the users are able to have a fuller experience of the higher flow fan. The program extracts the fan data via Facebook Graph API, parsing and mapping the data into the input values for the micro-controller, which in turn controls an AC power switch tail and a servo motor attaching to a rotary variable motor speed controller.This device supplies a multi-sensory experience by producing a cooling sensation, along with humming sounds and visual speeds, to make sure you donâ€™t only see the cool and hear the cool, but also feel it."
