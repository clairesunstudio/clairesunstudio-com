        "This is a rebranding exercise to help the Boston Group for Psychoanalytic Studies to implement a new logo. Working with a group of stakeholders, I first conducted a questionnaire understanding how they perceived the organization and its brand. Through the exercise I first determine with the client the most symbolic visual imageries for the group are a helix and a globe, representing the psychoanalytic and international aspects of this organization. I designed and tested using a palette green, blue and ruby red, that draws emotional connections to their values, which are calming, authoritative, global, academic and prestigious."
